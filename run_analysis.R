## This script will read in the data set from the "Human Activity Recognition
## Using Smartphone" Data Set and produce a file containing the merged test and 
## training data sets. The data will summarize all of the mean and 
## standard deviation data point. The summarized data points will be the average
## as grouped by activity and subject. 

#####
## Import the libraries that we will be using, if the library is missing
## the script will fail 
require (dplyr)

#####
## Script outputs
## finalData - Data Frame - contains the tidy data
## finalDataSummarized - Data Frame that contains the summarized data that
##                       will be written to a file as defined by the
##                       "fileDataSummarized" variable in the next section

## Read in the files that will be used to lable the data sets. 

## activities.txt contains the mapping from numeric to activitiy description
## Read in the activities.txt file

## factors.txt contains the labels for the columns in the data sets 
## Read in the factors.txt file 
features <- read.table (fileFeatures)
numCols <-nrow(features)

## Look for any column that contains "mean" or "std" in the description
## and store this in a vector. I use this vector to build a new vector that
## will be used by the "colClasses" arg in read.table so that the script only
## reads in the columns we want, and we don't have to clean up later
matchColumns <-grep ("\\-mean\\(\\)|\\-std\\(\\)", features$V2, perl=TRUE)

## Reorder out stat sets so that the added columns are on the left

## Merge the two data sets and clean up the temp tables
finalData<-merge (testing, training, all=TRUE)

## Convert our activities which are integers to factors
## This is the final cleanup of the data set.
